# summarizr

An application to summarize websites written in Python 3.8

Built on the FastAPI framework, tested using a combination of Starlette and PyTest, with a containerized postgres DB used to store info. 

Primary purpose of the project was to demonstrate TDD along with getting familiar with FastAPI, a very fast and high performance framework on par with NodeJS and Go.
